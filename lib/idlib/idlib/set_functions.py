    An implementation of the union-find data structure specific for
    iDISK Concepts.

    The routine starts by finding connections between pairs of concepts
    in the input using ``Union.find_connections()``. It then merges the
    connected concepts, always merging the concept with fewer of atoms
    into the concept with more atoms.

    This class can be used to generate a list of candidate connections,
    which can then be filtered, by passing ``run_union=False`` and then
    getting the ``connections`` attribute. Once filtered, they can be passed
    back in as the ``connections`` argument with ``run_union=True``.
    For example

    .. code-block:: python

        cnxs = Union(concepts, run_union=False).connections
        cnxs_filtered = filter_connections(concepts, cnxs)
        union = Union(concepts, connections=cnxs_filtered, run_union=True).result
